## **📦 Release Process (Maintainers Only)**

We use an automated GitHub Actions pipeline to publish to npm.

1. **Update Version**: Bump the version number in package.json (e.g., "version": "1.0.1").  
2. **Commit**: Your commit message **must** contain the word release: to trigger the publication workflow.  
   git commit \-m "release: v1.0.1"

3. **Push**: Push to the main branch.  
   * The CI will run tests and linting.  
   * If successful, it will:  
     * Publish the package to npm.  
     * Create a GitHub Release with the tag (e.g., v1.0.1).
